# Changelog

## v2.3.5-xmin.1 - 2026-06-17

### Features

- **Upstream v2.3.5 merge.** Merged the official v2.3.5 changes, including per-request upstream isolation, account in-flight indicators, `chatgpt_account_id` display, reset-credit hardening, `TRUSTED_PROXIES`, reset error localization, 1h metric granularity, and account card layout refinements.
- **Fork release packaging preserved.** Kept the fork release workflow, `VERSION`, and Nix packaging files used by the Home Manager release-tarball deployment path.

### Fixes

- **Fork behavior reconciliation.** Preserved the long compact account pool fallback, persistent compact transient retry, encrypted-content downgrade retry, and "Ignore all failure cooldowns" semantics while applying official v2.3.5 changes.

## v2.3.5 - 2026-06-17

### Features

- **Per-request upstream isolation by default (#268).** For requests without an explicit session, the upstream identity key (`prompt_cache_key` + session/conversation id) was previously derived deterministically from the downstream API key, so different requests sharing one API key collapsed onto the same upstream session id and leaked context across requests. The upstream identity is now decoupled from local connection reuse and account affinity: by default each sessionless request gets a unique upstream identity (`isolated` mode), while the 8-slot WS connection pool still routes by a stable API-key-derived pool key (preserving reuse and 503 handshake-throttle resistance) and account affinity is unchanged. Set `CODEX_REQUEST_ISOLATION_MODE=per-api-key` to restore the old shared-cache behavior.
- **Active in-flight request indicator (accounts).** The account list status column now shows a blue pill with a breathing dot and the live in-flight request count (`active_requests`), visible only when greater than zero, to surface which accounts are busy and how concurrent.
- **Display `chatgpt_account_id` (team workspace id).** The account list now shows the `chatgpt_account_id` (the team-plan workspace id decoded from the access-token JWT) under the email in monospace, so multiple workspaces under the same login email can be told apart.
- **Hardened + optimized OpenAI active reset-credits flow.** The wham/usage and reset/consume calls now go through the uTLS Chrome-fingerprint transport (matching the `/responses` gateway) to reduce Cloudflare blocks; consume reuses a single `redeem_request_id` as an idempotency key so a retry after refresh no longer burns an extra reset, a per-account mutex removes the check→consume TOCTOU race, a 401 auto-refreshes the token and retries once, and the post-reset wham round-trip is moved to the background to shorten the response path. Successful resets are written to `account_events` audit records.
- **`TRUSTED_PROXIES` env to configure trusted reverse proxies.** PR #265 disabled all trusted proxies (secure by default) but stripped the real client IP behind a reverse proxy; operators can now opt back in via `TRUSTED_PROXIES` (comma-separated IP/CIDR list). Empty/unset keeps the secure default; invalid entries fail fast at startup.
- **Localized upstream reset error codes.** When an active reset is rejected by upstream (e.g. `rate_limit_not_resettable` on business/credits-only plans), known codes are translated to a Chinese explanation with the original upstream JSON appended; unknown codes fall back to the raw upstream text, and empty bodies fall back to the status code.
- **1h metrics sampling granularity.** The 1h time range now samples at 1-minute granularity across 60 buckets.
- **Account card layout refinements.**

### Fixes

- **Discard broken upstream WS connections instead of reusing them.** After an upstream WS error (close 1006/1009/1011, broken pipe, unexpected EOF), `WsResponse.Close()` only removed the pending entry and returned the connection to the pool without closing the underlying socket, so the broken connection was misjudged reusable (a CLOSE_WAIT probe Ping still succeeds, a false positive) — causing slow first tokens / dropped streams and leaking fds in CLOSE_WAIT. Read errors now mark the connection broken, and `Close()` distinguishes normal completion (release for reuse) from abnormal termination (discard: close the socket and remove it from the pool via `CompareAndDelete`). Refs #267.
- **Refresh reset credits independent of usage freshness.** The reset-credits count is only refreshed by the wham/usage probe, but probing was gated on usage-snapshot freshness; since normal `/responses` traffic bumps that snapshot via response headers (which don't carry reset credits), busy accounts looked fresh and never got a wham probe. Reset-credit probe time is now tracked separately, and a zero-cost wham-only probe is allowed during rate-limited cooldown and premium 5h limits.
- **Disabled Gin's default trusted proxies (#265).**
- **Codex invite account dropdown only showed one account.** The account combobox pre-filled and filtered by the selected account's email, so opening it matched only that account; it now shows all eligible Codex OAuth accounts when opened and filters by text only while the user is actively typing.

## v2.3.4 - 2026-06-16

### Features

- **Account health visualization and "personal mode".** The account list/cards gain a "health status" bar (time-bucketed coloring based on recent request success/failure), the dashboard adds a system-level health overview between the top cards and usage stats, and the time-range selector is promoted to a page-level shared control. The accounts page adds a "pool mode / personal mode" toggle — personal mode renders accounts as richer two-column cards (avatar, equal-height alignment, icon+text action area), with the initial mode auto-selected by pool size on first upgrade.
- **Active reset credits for Codex (#249).** The account usage dialog, list badges, desktop table, and card action areas can all view the remaining "active reset count" and reset it in one click (with confirmation, refreshing after consuming 1), reusing the existing wham upstream path instead of the generic passthrough.
- **Prompt-filter review key (#257).** After a local rule match, an optional review model (OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible moderation) can re-check the request to reduce false positives; supports base_url / model / timeout / fail-closed configuration.
- **Blocked requests record full content and are queryable (#259).** Blocked requests now record the full request content in "prompt filter → logs" (no longer just a 500-char preview, truncated at 32K) and are included in search; in usage stats, cyber_policy errors can be clicked to view the full triggering request content.
- **Local token-counting compatibility endpoints (#238).** Added `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` and `POST /v1/responses/input_tokens`, which return a local `input_tokens` estimate without forwarding upstream or consuming quota, so clients like LiteLLM no longer get a 404 when probing token-counting endpoints.
- **Codex referral invite feature (#260).** Added a Codex referral invite UI and batch invite capability, plus an improved account picker (#264).
- **Deduplicate accounts by OAuth identity (#262).** Imported/added accounts are deduplicated by OAuth identity to avoid the same account entering the pool twice.
- **Account bulk-update API (#263).** Added a bulk account update endpoint supporting batch scheduling and other config changes.
- **Edit OAuth account auth config and re-authorize UI (#250).** Supports editing an existing OAuth account's auth config and re-authorizing from the frontend.
- **External async image task API (#254).** Added an external async image-generation task API.
- **Backend streaming forwarding performance (#252).** Optimized the streaming forwarding path performance.

### Fixes

- **Streaming cyber_policy penalties not recorded (#258).** cyber_policy bans are delivered as `response.failed` (HTTP 200) in Codex streaming responses, but previously only non-2xx errors were written to `prompt_filter_logs`, so streaming-path cyber_policy was invisible in the prompt-filter logs; recording is now added across the 4 streaming failure paths.
- **Failed image request usage not counted (#239).** Fixed error image-request records not showing in usage stats.
- **`/v1/messages` cached-token double billing (#253).** Anthropic usage now deducts cache-hit tokens to avoid double-billing the cached portion.
- **Claude Code tool argument sanitization correction (#251).** Fixed compatibility issues caused by overly broad tool argument sanitization.
- **Upgraded vite to fix npm audit high severity (#261).** Frontend dependency upgrade fixing an npm audit high vulnerability.

## v2.3.4-xmin.1 - 2026-06-16

### Features

- **Long compact account pool fallback.** Compact requests can fall back to accounts tagged `long-compact` after Cloudflare 524 / origin response timeout failures, keeping long-running compact sessions out of the regular account pool once that path is known to be healthier.
- **Ignore all failure cooldowns.** The existing per-account `ignore_usage_limit_429_cooldown` setting is now exposed as "Ignore all failure cooldowns" and consistently skips failure-induced account cooldown, model cooldown, usage-exhausted state, premium 5h cooldown, 401 cooldown, and unauthorized auto-cleanup writes.

### Fixes

- **Persistent compact transient retry.** Compact 502 / 5xx / relay `bad_response_status_code` failures keep retrying after the ordinary account-switch retry budget is exhausted, with encrypted reasoning content stripped only after repeated transient failures.
- **Upstream merge reconciliation.** Reconciled the local compact retry and cooldown behavior with upstream reset-credit, 5h usage freshness, account update, read-error retry, and locale changes.
- **Frontend dependency hash.** Updated the fixed npm dependency hash used by the Nix build after upstream frontend dependency changes.

## v2.3.0-xmin.3 - 2026-06-11

### Features

- **Per-account 401 handling override.** Added an account-level option to treat upstream HTTP 401 responses as ordinary client errors. When enabled, 401 responses no longer mark the account as banned, set unauthorized cooldowns, trigger unauthorized auto-cleanup, or consume 401 retry budget; streaming `response.failed` frames inferred as 401 follow the same behavior.

### Fixes

- **Release latest ref ordering.** The release workflow now updates the `latest` branch only after GitHub Actions has created the release and uploaded all release assets successfully.

## v2.3.3 - 2026-06-13

### Features

- **Cloud storage links for image generation (#240).** When S3-compatible cloud storage is configured and a client requests `response_format=url`, `/v1/images/generations` now uploads each generated image to object storage and returns a time-limited (1h) presigned link instead of a base64 data URL, falling back to the data URL on any upload or signing failure so the API never hard-fails on storage misconfig. Uploaded images are registered into the admin gallery via a lazily created synthetic job + asset record, so they appear in gallery/history and are cleaned up (DB row + backing object) on delete.
- **API key token-limit unit selector (#234).** The API key 5h/7d token limit fields now offer a unit selector (token / K / M / B) so large quotas can be entered and displayed in readable units instead of raw token counts.

### Fixes

- **Request forwarding error handling and success accounting (#246).** Hardened the OpenAI Responses `ttftGuard` call site with explicit nil-safe wrapping, handled OpenAI/Codex compact response-body read failures while preserving the final 502, synced usage headers on Codex compact read failure and reported request success on the happy path, and rebuilt the Anthropic stream error SSE payload via `json.Marshal`.
- **WebSocket relay stability (#247).** Improved `wsrelay` executor, manager, and session handling to keep upstream WebSocket relay connections stable.
- **Function `tool_choice` shape normalized.** A `tool_choice` object missing `type` but carrying a `function` object or top-level `name` is now normalized to `type: "function"` with a flattened `name`, matching OpenAI SDK convention so the upstream no longer rejects the request.
- **Missing encrypted reasoning content (#235).** `missing_required_parameter` errors on a `*.encrypted_content` param are now recognized alongside `invalid_encrypted_content`, so requests with absent encrypted reasoning content are retried instead of failing.
- **5h usage freshness split from 7d (#241).** The 5h usage snapshot now persists its own `codex_5h_usage_updated_at` timestamp instead of overwriting the shared `codex_usage_updated_at`, so 5h and 7d freshness no longer clobber each other.
- **Usage logs page size up to 500 (#244).** The usage logs endpoint now accepts a page size of 500.
- **Read pages sanitizer narrowed (#245).** Tightened the Read pages sanitizer scope.

### Features

- **Group filter: ungrouped and exclude modes (#229).** The account group filter now supports an "ungrouped" quick option and per-group tri-state filtering (only / hide / off), so accounts outside chosen groups can be isolated, selected in bulk, and assigned to a group quickly. The groups column is also shown by default in the table view.

### Fixes

- **`gpt-5.3-codex-spark` no longer receives the default image tool (#230).** The Responses translator auto-injected the hosted `image_generation` tool (plus bridge instructions) into ordinary text requests; spark rejects hosted image tools, so text-only spark requests failed on the HTTP upstream path. The default injection is now skipped for spark while explicitly supplied image tools are still honored.
- **Tools without a `type` field no longer fail requests (#219).** Tool definitions missing `type` (or with `type: null`) were forwarded verbatim and the upstream rejected the whole request with 400 `Unsupported tool type: None`. Function-shaped tools (a nested `function` object or a top-level `name`) are now treated as `type: "function"` per OpenAI SDK convention on both the Chat Completions and Responses paths; unrecognizable typeless tools are dropped instead of failing the request.
- **Usage logs are requeued when a flush fails (#233).** Failed usage-log batches are put back at the front of the buffer and retried on the next flush instead of being dropped, and usage-log inserts plus API key quota updates now run in a single transaction on both SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- **Reduced timer allocations while waiting for Redis token refresh (#231).** `WaitForRefreshComplete` now reuses a single ticker and timeout timer instead of allocating a new timer every 200ms poll (previously up to ~150 timers per 30s wait).

### Performance

- **Request bodies are read once and reused (#232).** `RequestSizeLimiter` caches the body it already reads, and the body-cache middleware plus all JSON proxy handlers reuse it, cutting up to ~2/3 of duplicated request-body buffer allocations on hot paths.

## v2.3.1 - 2026-06-11

### Features

- **Group-level and global auto-pause thresholds (#227).** Usage auto-pause thresholds can now be set globally (Settings) and per account group (group dialog), resolved with account > group > global priority. Account-level settings win when present, otherwise the smallest non-zero group threshold applies, falling back to the global default. Changes take effect immediately without a restart, and out-of-range values are rejected consistently across all three levels.
- **API key concurrency limits (#226).** Each API key can cap its concurrent in-flight requests via `limits.max_concurrency`. Requests over the cap receive 429 with a descriptive message across all proxy entrances (responses, compact, chat completions, Anthropic messages, images, WebSocket turns). Unset or 0 means unlimited.
- **Account group multi-select binding (#217, #222).** Account group assignment now uses a searchable multi-select dropdown instead of assigning new groups to all accounts.

### Fixes

- **WebSocket prompt cache restored (#202).** Since v2.2.7, requests without an explicit session identifier got a random per-request `stateless-` ID on the WS upstream path, which leaked into `prompt_cache_key` and the WS handshake session headers — so the upstream prompt cache never hit in WS mode (HTTP was unaffected). WS now injects a deterministic cache key derived from the downstream API key (matching HTTP behavior), restoring cache hits (~86% of input tokens on repeated prefixes in live testing).
- **WebSocket connection reuse under high RPM.** Sessionless requests previously opened a new WS connection per request; sustained load (~200 RPM) triggered upstream handshake throttling (`bad handshake` → 503). Such requests now reuse warm connections from a per-(account, cache key) slot pool (8 slots, falling back to one-shot connections when all slots are busy). Live testing at 200 RPM went from 128/200 success to 200/200 with zero handshake failures and roughly halved latency.
- **Codex CLI compact v2 input items (#224).** `/responses` no longer returns 400 `Invalid input type 'compaction_trigger'` for Codex CLI compact v2 payloads.
- **Usage probed immediately after OAuth account add.** Newly added OAuth accounts get an immediate usage probe instead of waiting for the next cycle.
- **Account table scrolling.** Adjusted account table scrolling behavior in the admin UI.

## v2.3.0 - 2026-06-10

### Features

- **Account recycle bin.** Soft-deleted accounts now land in a recycle bin instead of vanishing. Accounts can be restored to the runtime pool without a restart, test-connected before restoring (429/usage-limit results are recorded as rate-limited rather than failed), batch-tested with an optional auto-restore-on-pass toggle, filtered by plan type and searched with pagination, and permanently purged behind a typed confirmation enforced on the API as well.
- **Client IP in usage logs.** Usage records now capture the requesting client IP and display it in the usage views.

### Fixes

- **Relay accounts on `/v1/messages` and `/v1/chat/completions` (#181).** Both endpoints now schedule OpenAI Responses (relay API-key) accounts and forward over HTTP like `/v1/responses`, instead of returning 503 "No available accounts" once Codex OAuth accounts were rate-limited on relay-only deployments.
- **Image generation no longer routed over WebSocket (#220).** Requests carrying an `image_generation` tool (including the auto-injected one) are forced onto HTTP, and requests that do go over WS get the auto-injected image tool, its `tool_choice`, and bridge instructions stripped, so image generation can no longer stall WS streams on large base64 payloads.
- **Image SSE keep-alive.** Image generation SSE streams now stay alive through long upstream pauses, preventing idle disconnects mid-generation.
- **Account rate-limit state sync.** Rate-limit state observed by usage probes and WHAM checks is synced back to runtime account state so scheduling and status displays stay consistent.
- **Account status summary counts.** Admin account status summary counters now align with the account list filters.

### Security

- **Code-scanning hardening.** Local image storage rejects keys containing path separators on write and `..` traversal segments on read/delete (legacy relative refs keep working); remote-migration and sub2api import URLs must be complete http/https URLs with a host; SVG logo minification strips comments to a fixed point so `<!--` cannot survive sanitization.

## v2.2.9 - 2026-06-09

### Features

- **Account proxy validation (#212).** Added proxy test controls across account add/edit, OAuth generation, and OpenAI Responses account forms, backed by an admin proxy test endpoint that reports reachability, latency, IP, and location.
- **Usage range and reset-time display.** Dashboard usage cards now label and query the selected time range instead of always showing "today", and account quota reset labels now display precise seconds with full timestamps available in tooltips.

### Fixes

- **WebSocket message-too-big fallback (#214).** Upstream WebSocket `close 1009` / `message too big` failures before the first downstream token now fall back to HTTP for the same request instead of rotating accounts through another WS attempt, with logs classified as `message_too_big`.
- **CPA/sub2api JSON import (#215).** JSON imports now avoid treating repeated or conflicting ChatGPT account IDs as the same account when credentials differ, fixing failed or collapsed imports from CPA/sub2api export files.
- **Batch account test state updates.** Batch connection tests now update account status consistently with single-account tests, including `response.failed`, unauthorized, generic upstream errors, and usage-limit results; successful tests still recover stale banned/cooldown state.
- **Quota auto-pause scheduling (#216).** Accounts that reached configured usage thresholds remain out of scheduling while their quota window is still active, and stale reset timestamps are ignored so reset/cooldown state does not linger incorrectly.

## v2.2.8 - 2026-06-08

### Features

- **Account usage analytics.** Expanded the account usage details modal with Overview, Details, and Quality views, range-aware totals, richer model distribution controls, and quality signals including error rate, retry count, average first-token latency, P95 response time, streaming ratio, and compact ratio.
- **Batch account import workflow.** Refresh Token batch import now has progress feedback and kicks off usage sampling so newly imported accounts do not require a separate manual batch test before usage data becomes visible.
- **First-token mode setting (#207).** Added a system setting for strict vs loose first-token detection, making TTFT behavior configurable while keeping thinking/pre-output events from being counted incorrectly in strict mode.
- **Usage visibility controls (#203, #209, #210).** Usage stats now support additional time ranges, full token-number display, compact request markers, and dedicated WS/Fast request badges.

### Fixes

- **Batch account test consistency (#194).** Batch tests now match single-account tests more closely by using the WHAM usage preflight and parsing real SSE terminal events from a short request; `response.failed`, missing output, and `usage_limit_reached` are no longer treated as successful account recovery.
- **Forced WebSocket usage logs (#205, #210).** Requests forced through upstream WebSocket now persist and display the `via_websocket` marker correctly, with Fast tier shown as its own request badge.
- **Responses compact and quota handling (#174, #201).** OpenAI Responses API-key accounts can forward `/v1/responses/compact`, and nested `usage_limit_reached` errors are handled consistently for cooldown and sampling.
- **Billing tier policy persistence (#206).** `billing_tier_policy` now stays aligned across frontend save behavior, backend normalization, and database persistence.
- **OAuth authorization UX.** OAuth authorization links can be regenerated and copied reliably, including HTTP admin deployments where the Clipboard API may be unavailable.
- **Image and WS routing stability (#198).** Explicit image generation requests bypass forced WS routing, and `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` scheduling/model filtering is hardened.

## v2.2.7 - 2026-06-05

### Features

- **WebSocket silent retry controls (#195).** Added Codex upstream WS settings for hiding upstream errors, silently retrying pre-first-token upstream failures, and capping silent retries (`codex_ws_hide_upstream_errors`, `codex_ws_silent_retry_enabled`, `codex_ws_silent_max_retries`). These settings are available in the admin UI and persist through both Postgres and SQLite.
- **WHAM-only usage probe controls.** Added runtime/admin controls so usage probes can rely on the zero-cost WHAM endpoint without falling back to `/responses` probes when that is preferred.

### Fixes

- **WS upstream failure handling (#195).** Retryable upstream WS failures before the first token, including usage-limit, 429, 5xx, read errors, timeouts, and EOFs, now stay server-side while codex2api switches accounts and rebuilds the upstream WS connection. If retries are exhausted, clients receive a unified friendly message while the original upstream error remains in backend logs and usage records.
- **Responses routing and model hardening (#198).** Hardened `/v1/responses` routing for recent Codex models including `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, widened local plan gating so stale local `plan_type` records do not incorrectly block real upstream calls, and improved WS/TTFT handling around response payload content.
- **OpenAI Responses compact routing.** OpenAI Responses API accounts added with `base_url` + `api_key` can now use `/v1/responses/compact`; compact bodies are normalized for that upstream path instead of being sent through the ChatGPT-only compact route.
- **Usage-limit detection.** `usage_limit_reached` is now recognized even when wrapped inside `response.error`, `response.status_details`, or upstream 5xx-shaped payloads, so exhausted accounts are treated as quota-limited consistently.
- **Accounts toolbar wrapping.** Improved the admin accounts toolbar layout so search/filter/action controls wrap cleanly on narrower viewports.
- **Security scan recovery.** Updated React Router to a patched release and raised the Go toolchain directive to `1.26.4`, clearing the failing frontend npm audit and backend govulncheck jobs.

## v2.2.6 - 2026-06-03

### Features

- **Codex upstream WebSocket mode.** Added an opt-in `codex_force_websocket` system setting that routes Codex upstream traffic over a persistent WebSocket long-connection (reusing the `wsrelay` connection pool), reducing per-request TLS/handshake overhead to better match the official CLI. Disabled by default; when off, requests keep using the existing HTTP path. A downstream `https://.../v1/responses` (or `/v1/chat/completions`) HTTP POST is transparently forwarded as a `wss://` upstream connection.
- **Idle WS keepalive.** Added `codex_ws_keepalive_enabled` and `codex_ws_keepalive_interval_sec` (default 60s) to keep idle upstream WebSocket connections alive with background Ping frames. Keepalive never opens new connections and never sends business frames, so it consumes zero account quota. Disabled by default.
- **WS request badge.** The Usage log now shows a `ws` badge between the status code and model for requests that went over WebSocket.
- **Dedicated WebSocket settings card.** WS-related settings are split out of the crowded scheduling card into their own full-width "WebSocket (Codex Upstream)" card in the admin UI.
- **Bundled Codex CLI bump.** Updated the bundled Codex CLI version from `0.128.0` to `0.136.0` for a more faithful fingerprint and access to newer models.

### Fixes

- **WS upstream error passthrough.** Upstream WebSocket error frames are now relayed to the client as a `response.failed` SSE event preserving the original error, instead of being turned into a low-level read error that surfaced as a mysterious empty response / 32-90s hang. Any upstream error (rate limit, unsupported model, invalid parameter) is now visible to the client.
- **WS transport robustness.** Fixed the `wsrelay` dialer copy dropping `NetDialContext` (TCP KeepAlive never took effect); added 64KB read/write buffers with a shared write-buffer pool for large 48-91KB upstream frames; replaced the fixed 10ms busy-connection spin with exponential backoff plus a max-wait timeout; raised the read timeout from 60s to 120s so long-reasoning turns are not falsely disconnected; and log a warning when a WS path silently falls back to HTTP.
- **TLS session resumption.** Standard and uTLS transports now share a `ClientSessionCache`, so reconnects use TLS resumption (1-RTT) to cut cold-connection cost. Bumped `MaxIdleConnsPerHost` and `IdleConnTimeout`, and switched the HTTP server to explicit `ReadHeaderTimeout`/`IdleTimeout` with graceful shutdown (keeping `WriteTimeout` at 0 so streaming responses are never cut off).
- **Account lookup O(N) → O(1).** The store now keeps a `DBID → account` index, so session-affinity hot paths and all `FindByID` lookups no longer scan the account slice linearly.

## v2.2.5 - 2026-06-02

### Features

- **Codex model registry and reasoning models (#165).** Added system-setting controls for upstream-synced base models and reasoning-effort variants so model list entries can be configured from the admin UI.
- **Codex model redirect mapping (#189, #190).** Added a dedicated Codex model redirect map that can route downstream model names to another Codex model while preserving request reasoning effort.
- **Account quota auto-pause controls.** Added 5h/7d usage-threshold auto-pause controls with global defaults, per-account disables, edit-account controls, and batch editing.
- **Compact request visibility.** Usage logs now detect compact requests and show a compact badge alongside request model/reasoning information.
- **Email domain account tags (#191).** Account management now derives email domains, supports domain filtering with banned/total stats, searches by domain, and lets users show or hide domain badges.
- **Configuration examples.** Updated Codex config examples to cover the current model mapping and reasoning-effort setup.

### Fixes

- **Service-tier billing semantics (#183).** Split requested, actual, and billing service-tier handling so billing policy stays explicit when upstream reports a different actual tier.
- **SQLite and admin billing stability (#185, #186).** Stabilized account billing window reads and SQLite access paths so large account pools do not turn simple admin/API-key queries into transient 503s.
- **Account status and probe handling.** Unauthorized account errors are recorded more consistently, and batch account rendering has less unnecessary work at scale.
- **Refresh token reuse handling.** Reused refresh tokens are now treated as non-retryable credential errors instead of entering avoidable retry paths.

## v2.2.4 - 2026-05-28

### Features

- **Scheduler warm-tier bypass (#176).** Added a scheduler option to skip warm-tier demotion so selected accounts can stay in the healthy scheduling lane.
- **API Reference image previews.** The Try it panel now renders image responses directly when `/v1/images/generations` or `/v1/images/edits` returns `b64_json`, image URLs, or Responses-style image output, while still keeping the raw JSON visible.
- **Long-context billing details (#178).** Usage cost tooltips now expose when long-context pricing is active (`input_tokens > 272,000`) and show the actual input, output, and cache-read unit prices used for the request.
- **Root changelog.** Moved the project changelog to the repository root so release notes and documentation links point to a stable location.

### Fixes

- **WebSocket response continuity (#182).** Fixed WS mode context loss so `previous_response_id` continuation remains connected across `/v1/responses` WebSocket turns.
- **First-token timeout retries (#172).** First-token timeouts now retry by account-pool round and clear transient unavailable markers after the pool has been tried, reducing false "no available account" failures for small pools.
- **Banned-account test recovery.** Successful account tests now recover stale banned/error state instead of leaving the account marked unhealthy after the probe succeeds.
- **Bounded batch account tests.** Batch account tests now keep their execution bounded so duplicate or repeated test requests do not destabilize account state handling.
- **Version popover clipping.** The version popover is rendered through a portal so sidebar overflow no longer clips the latest-version panel.

## v2.2.3 - 2026-05-27

### Features

- **Usage reset radar.** New `/subscriptions` page consolidates the Codex Reset Radar summary, recent RSS events, and a reset-time hook. When a window-close signal is detected the backend clears stale cooldown/usage caches and re-tests every account so the pool reflects the new reset boundary immediately.
- **Streaming batch operations in admin.** Account batch refresh/test/enable/disable/lock/reset now stream per-account progress events (`success/banned/rate_limited/failed`) to the admin UI instead of waiting for the full operation to complete.
- **Compact usage number setting.** Added a system setting to render token counts with K/M units in the usage table for easier reading at scale.
- **Card view for account management.** Desktop accounts page gains a table/card view toggle (up to 5 cards per row on `xl` screens). Choice is persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Status badge error tooltip.** Hovering an `unauthorized` or `error` status badge now surfaces the full upstream error message in a popover, matching the usage log status code tooltip style.
- **Anthropic `speed: fast` forwarding (#170).** Anthropic-style `speed: fast` requests now map to the Codex priority tier upstream so fast clients get fast tokens end-to-end.

### Fixes

- **Version popover always clickable.** The sidebar version badge now opens the popover even when the GitHub latest-version lookup is still pending or blocked; a "checking…" hint is shown until the remote tag arrives.
- **First-token timeout and scheduler races.** Hardened the proxy path so first-token timeouts and concurrent scheduler races no longer collapse into a spurious "no available account" 503.
- **`/responses` WebSocket ingress.** WebSocket clients hitting `ws://host/v1/responses` are now accepted; the prior 404/101 misclassification has been fixed. Setting `CODEX_UPSTREAM_TRANSPORT=ws` no longer reports the connect handshake as an unknown error.
- **Anthropic content preservation + deactivated probe flagging.** Anthropic-shaped responses keep their original content blocks; deactivated accounts are clearly flagged in probe state instead of silently appearing healthy.
- **Wham window classification.** Usage window classification now uses `limit_window_seconds` rather than field position, so free-tier accounts no longer have a 7d window misclassified as 5h.

## v2.2.2 - 2026-05-26

### Features

- **First-run setup and admin auth polish.** Added setup guidance for unconfigured deployments, improved the admin authentication flow, and added a frontend logout path.
- **Runtime status API and page.** Added machine-readable runtime checks for service, database, cache, usage log writer, probes, account pool, image storage, and admin auth.
- **Background media customization.** Added configurable background image/video support, realtime glass opacity/blur controls, and raised MP4 dynamic wallpaper uploads to 40MB while keeping image uploads capped at 20MB.
- **Quick-start configuration options.** Added fast-mode and reasoning-effort snippets for supported client templates in the usage docs.
- **Issue templates.** Added structured Chinese and English GitHub issue templates for bugs, ideas, UI feedback, deployment help, and questions.

### Fixes

- **Request body sizing for wallpapers.** Raised the default request body limit to 48MB so 40MB MP4 background uploads can pass multipart overhead safely.

# Changelog — iteration/may-2026-v2

Dates: 2026-05-13 to 2026-05-20. 17 commits.

## Features

- **Credit quota support (#141).** Added `credit_enabled` and `credit_skip_usage_window` flags to the accounts table. Credit-marked accounts skip usage-window penalties in the scheduler. Managed via `PATCH /api/admin/accounts/:id/credit`.

- **Scheduler mode (#133).** Added `scheduler_mode` system setting with two modes: `round_robin` (default, weighted by dispatch score) and `remaining_quota` (prioritize accounts with lowest usage percent). Configurable from Admin Settings page.

- **5h/7d windowed USD cost display.** Replaced the single total-cost column with a windowed billing view. Each account now shows `billed_5h` and `billed_7d` fields aligned with the account's usage-reset boundaries. This reflects actual spending, not estimated token costs.

- **Image-to-image in Image Studio (#135, #136).** The admin Image Studio now supports image-to-image generation via `POST /api/admin/images/edit-jobs`, accepting reference image URLs or data URIs. Added text-to-image and image-to-image tabs in the frontend.

- **Billing model expansion.** Added pricing for gpt-5.5-pro and gpt-5.4-pro families. Implemented long context (>272K tokens) premium pricing for gpt-5.5, gpt-5.5-pro, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.4-pro with automatic detection. Fixed gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini cache-read pricing.

## Fixes

- **GPT-5.5 pricing corrected.** Updated standard-tier billing from old values to $5.00/M input / $30.00/M output (priority: $12.50/M / $75.00/M), matching current official pricing.

- **SSE stream isolation.** Prevented SSE response mixing when retrying across accounts, using `c.Writer.Written()` as the retry guard instead of a package-level flag.

- **Usage logging for image errors.** Added usage-log emits for read-error paths in image generation, ensuring billing records are not silently dropped on stream failures.

- **Model mapping initialization.** Restored `modelMapping` init that was accidentally removed during the scheduler_mode refactor.

- **Credit field Scan order.** Fixed PostgreSQL `Scan` argument ordering for credit fields that was causing silent zero-values.

- **Round 2 review fixes.** Addressed Haiku review findings including api.ts syntax cleanup, billing test corrections, and several CRITICAL/HIGH issues from automated review.

## Security

- **SQLite default binds to localhost.** SQLite compose files (`docker-compose.sqlite.yml`, `docker-compose.sqlite.local.yml`) now bind ports to `127.0.0.1` by default. Previously they bound to `0.0.0.0`, exposing the service on all interfaces. Standard (PostgreSQL) compose files retain the `0.0.0.0` default.

- **BIND_HOST env var.** Added `BIND_HOST` environment variable support to control the HTTP listen address across all deployment modes. Documented in `.env.example`, `.env.sqlite.example`, and `CONFIGURATION.md`.

## Breaking Changes

- **SQLite compose port binding.** SQLite deployments upgrading from a previous version that relied on external access via the default compose configuration must now explicitly set `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env` or override the port binding in the compose file. All other behavior remains backwards-compatible.
